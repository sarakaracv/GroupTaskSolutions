/*
Create a few clients object from Client class.
3. Put them into firstly Array as a client database.
4. Add "show client detail" functionality.
When it is selected from menu it shows client information details.
5. Add "transfer money" functionality
When it is selected it asks client_id to whom the money transfer,
and amount of money to transfer.
6. Due to these 2 funtionality menu should be changed as well
7. You may create all these functionality according to your creativity
which means you may create new methods under main class or create utility package ,
or in client class as a behaviour or what else .
It is your design, your idea. :)))
