Overview : Right now in Bank App each Client has only one Base Account .
Last week at the begining as a brute force solution for client account idea
of creating second arraylist and manupilating this arrarylist according to  client id
was the bacic approach. And then for the better solution we add Account class into Client
class as a attribute(has a relation) But still there is only one account for each client.

Your Task :
1. Change Account attribute under Client for 2 accounts for each client,
2. under main method in options(option 4) there is createInvestAccount Method but it is not available, create this method
which is creating  new InvestAccount for  Client.
3. Change deposit method for transferring money from client balance to same client invest account balance.


Good Luck.
